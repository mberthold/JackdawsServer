Moving Frontline - Without interference from the players Blue is supposed to loose!
Somewhat dynamic Engagements - The battle shouldn't always take place at the exact same place!

RED Flanking attacks (through the mountains)
Cargo events - Special equipment being brought forward

If red loses that should have some serious consequences - like a big SAM in range of Hatay!

Helicopter CAS

Progression via Zones
- how does one attack a zone?
- does one set up an FSM to move combat between zones?
