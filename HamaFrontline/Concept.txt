Moving Frontline - Without interference from the players Blue is supposed to loose!
Somewhat dynamic Engagements - The battle shouldn't always take place at the exact same place!
RED CAS - Helicopters over the area
RED Falnking attacks (through the mountains)
Cargo events - Special equipment being brought forward

If red loses that should have some serious consequences - like a big SAM in range of Hatay!
